A. Application Programming Interface (API)
1. What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs enable developers to access specific features or data of an application, service, or platform without needing to understand its internal codebase.

2. Definition
An API is a software interface that facilitates the exchange of data and functionality between different systems, applications, or components. It acts as a bridge that allows one system to "talk" to another.

3. APIs and Web Services
APIs are often used in web services, which are services available over the internet. These web APIs allow applications to interact with remote servers or services to perform tasks like:

Retrieving data
Sending updates
Authenticating users
B. Types of APIs
1. Online APIs (Web APIs)
These APIs operate over the internet and are used for web-based communication.

Type	Description
REST API	Representational State Transfer – uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
SOAP API	Simple Object Access Protocol – uses XML for structured messaging.
2. Offline APIs
These APIs are used within systems that do not require internet connectivity.

Type	Description
Operating System APIs	Allow applications to interact with the OS (e.g., Windows API).
Hardware APIs	Enable software to communicate with hardware components.
Application APIs	Provide access to features within a specific application (e.g., Excel API).
